## Molecular Dynamics

This is a molecular dynamics simulation for a nobel gas. The simulation uses the Lenard-Jones potential (6-12 potential)
 for simulating molecular forces. We use the Verlet algorithm. The graphics set up according to the 
[Pendulum3](https://github.com/AlexErdei73/Pendulum3/tree/main) project. More information can be found on page 82 of the
 [Physics Simulation Manual](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/javacourse/javamanual.pdf).
